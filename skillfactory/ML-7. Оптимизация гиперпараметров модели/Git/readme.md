- The practice is based on the Kaggle competition: Prediction of a Biological Reaction.

- The data is presented in CSV format.  Each row represents a molecule. 

<div align="justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first Activity column contains experimental data describing the actual biological response [0, 1]; The remaining columns D1-D1776 represent molecular descriptors â€” these are calculated properties that can capture some characteristics of the molecule, such as size, shape or composition of elements.</div>
